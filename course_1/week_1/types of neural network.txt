1. Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
Description: The simplest type of artificial neural network. Information moves in one direction: from input to hidden layers (if any), and finally to the output layer.
Use Case:
Image recognition
Simple classification tasks
Key Feature: No feedback loops; inputs are passed forward through the layers.

2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Description: CNNs are primarily used for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to detect spatial hierarchies in data by applying filters.
Use Case:
Image classification (e.g., object detection)
Video analysis
Medical image analysis
Key Feature: Convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers for spatial feature extraction.

3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
Description: RNNs are designed for sequential data. Unlike feedforward networks, they have loops allowing information to be passed from one step to the next.
Use Case:
Time-series forecasting
Natural language processing (NLP)
Speech recognition
Key Feature: Hidden states that allow processing of temporal sequences and retain memory of previous inputs.

4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Description: LSTMs are a specialized form of RNN designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem. They can learn long-term dependencies by controlling what information is remembered or forgotten.
Use Case:
Time-series prediction
Text generation
Speech synthesis
Key Feature: LSTM cells have gates (input, forget, and output) to regulate memory flow over long sequences.

5. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
Description: GRUs are a simplified variant of LSTMs. They also manage long-term dependencies but with fewer gates and simpler architecture.
Use Case:
Similar to LSTM applications (time-series, NLP)
Key Feature: Fewer parameters than LSTM, faster to train, but performs comparably on many tasks.

6. Autoencoder
Description: Autoencoders are unsupervised learning models used for tasks like data compression and denoising. They learn a compressed representation of input data (encoding) and then reconstruct the original data (decoding).
Use Case:
Dimensionality reduction
Anomaly detection
Image denoising
Key Feature: Encoder-decoder architecture; used for unsupervised learning.

7. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
Description: GANs consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other. The generator tries to create fake data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data.
Use Case:
Image generation
Deepfake creation
Style transfer
Key Feature: Adversarial training that pits two models against each other to improve the quality of generated data.

8. Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)
Description: RBFNs are a type of feedforward neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. They are often used for interpolation and approximation tasks.
Use Case:
Function approximation
Time-series prediction
Key Feature: Uses radial basis functions for neuron activations, often applied in regression tasks.

9. Transformer Network
Description: A cutting-edge neural network architecture, the transformer is designed for handling sequential data, but unlike RNNs, it doesnâ€™t process data in order. It uses a mechanism called self-attention to weigh the importance of each part of the sequence.
Use Case:
Natural language processing (e.g., language models like GPT)
Machine translation
Text summarization
Key Feature: Attention mechanism and parallelization, enabling efficient processing of sequences.

10. Modular Neural Network (MNN)
Description: MNNs consist of multiple independent sub-networks (modules), where each performs a specific task. The outputs of these sub-networks are combined to produce the final output.
Use Case:
Complex tasks that require decomposing into sub-tasks
Key Feature: Modular approach, useful for solving large-scale problems by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts.

11. Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
Description: SOMs are unsupervised learning models that use competitive learning to map high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional space (often 2D), preserving topological properties.
Use Case:
Data visualization
Clustering
Key Feature: Useful for mapping and visualizing high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.

12. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN)
Description: Inspired by biological neurons, SNNs work by simulating neurons that "spike" (fire) when certain thresholds are reached. They are considered more biologically plausible compared to traditional networks.
Use Case:
Neuroscience research
Neuromorphic computing
Key Feature: Use of spike-timing and thresholds, more closely mimicking real brain activity.
